# 💳 Credit Risk Analysis using GAN, LightGBM & Optuna

This project predicts the likelihood of **credit risk** for loan applicants using advanced AI techniques including **GAN-based feature generation**, **ADASYN oversampling**, and **LightGBM** for classification. It’s built in **Google Colab** and supports model deployment and test prediction.
